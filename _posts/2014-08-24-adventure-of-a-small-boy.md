There was a small boy who was 6 years old. He loved nature and always used to ask his parents if he could go around an learn about nature. His parents would say that they had lots of work and could not visit nature to learn more about it. He used to ask if he could go alone but his parents would say that he was very young and could go when he was 18 years old.

Years passed and it was the boy's 18 birthday. His parents gave him a wonderful gift that he could visit nature! He began with the Fallington ocean. When he reached the ocean, he asked a man why it is called 'The Fallington Ocean'? He said if a person who is afraid of heights loks down, that person will faint and may fall down in the ocean.

He turned around and saw a girl going to look in the ocean. He ran to tell the girl and warn her but it was too late. She looked in and she was afraid of heights! Without thinking, the boy jumped in and caught the girl and held onto a stone. He climbed up with the help of stones.

He put the girl on land but he could not come up. The girl woke up and helped the boy to climb. The boy told her about the Fallington. They told their good-byes and left.

Next, the boy went to the Forbidden Forest. He nicely explored and took lots of photos of animals and had lots of fun. He was going to the exit when he saw a river blocking the way. He saw a boat and thought he could cross the river by boat. Suddenly, a girl appeared.

She said, "You will be stuck until you answer my riddles". The boy answered them all! Here are the riddles:

Q: How to put a giraffe in the fridge in 3 steps?  
A: Open the fridge, put the giraffe, close the fridge.

Q: How to put an elephant in the fridge in 4 steps?  
A: Open the fridge, take the giraffe out, put the elephant, close the fridge.

Q: It was the lion's birthday, one animal was missing. Which one and why?  
A: Elephant because it was in the fridge!

Q: A landy wanted to cross the river but there were crocodiles in it. How did she cross?  
A: The crocodiles were in the lion's birthday!

The girl said that he was very intelligent. She said, "I am giving you two wishes. Think wisely. Before you choose, I'll tell you a small thing: frogs stuck by not going needs help. If you are clever, you will get it."

"That makes no sense", said the boy. He thought for 10 seconds and said, "I wish all the frogs in this lake will get free from the curse."

He understood what the girl asked! Suddenly, all frogs in the river turned into human beings and thy ran for the exit.

She gave the second clue now. It was: curse of a fairy for a beautiful lady. The boy got confused. "You are smart, you will answer this", said the girl.

He again understood what she said. "I wish you get free from your curse", said the boy. Suddenly, the girl turned into a fairy, the river turned into land. the fairy told her story about how she turned into a girl. She said "thank you" and left.

The boy went home and told his parents about his adventure.
