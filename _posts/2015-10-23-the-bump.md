title: The Bump

There is a bump in my heart like a ball of fire  
It's smiles brightly when I be much nicer

But sometimes it almost burns me down when it is sad  
That part of it makes me mad  

It never stays at one place, it always moves around  
When it burns really badly I fall on the ground

Kindness is the bump, hope you have it  
It gets smaller when someone by gets hit
