The morning begins with a bright day  
Shining through the afternoon too hot to even say  
Hurray!  
Today is gonna be a beautiful day  
Hurray!  
We are gonna have fun and play  
Hurray!

We can dance in the morning and sing all afternoon  
In both we'll be shining brighter than the sun and moon  
We can play all evening and sleep all night  
Dozing off in the moon's bright light  
We can hear the birds tweet all day  
Their song of everyone's happiness and gay  
Seeing them you have to say  
Hurray!  
Today is gonna be a beautiful day
