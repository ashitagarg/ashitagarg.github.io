There was a man once I knew  
He had long hair which he grew 

He had a long beard and his name was Dumbledore  
To protect Harry Potter he was aiming for

But he died before you could say  
Dumbledore's life was a great dismay 

But he was a nice man through and through  
He made tough choices whenever he had to
