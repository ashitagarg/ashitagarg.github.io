Do you remember me  
Have you forgotten me  
Will you prove to me  
This song was unncessary

The memory doesn't last long  
So I wanted to make it fun  
You came and now my work is undone  
That's what is in this song

I thought I could go further than this  
I thought I could reach the sky  
You came and you pulled me down  
Just when I thought I could fly

You came to destroy me  
You came and now I am not free  
You came to ruin my life  
You came to make sure I die

But I won't let you succeed
