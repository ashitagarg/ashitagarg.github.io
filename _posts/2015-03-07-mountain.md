Living on a mountain is to go up and down slopes,  
Living on a mountain is to never lose your hopes.

Living on a mountain is to always do your best,  
Living on a mountain is to not fall down like a nest.

Living on a mountain is to do everything alright,  
Living on a mountain is to be home before night.

If you go there, you will stop playing with your doll,  
Over there you can go to a waterfall.

On mountains the fun never goes,  
On mountains get your photo clicked with your best pose.

It is free and fun,  
to go and run.

That is the best place to enjoy your day,  
You can live happy and gay.  
For the rest of your life, you can live happy and gay.
