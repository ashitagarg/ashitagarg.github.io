title: If Voices Had Colors

I always wondered why voices don't have colors. I wondered for a long time when one day I asked my father about this. He said that they could have colors and he thought what I was thinking was very interesting. I guessed my family's voice colors. My mother is yellow, my father is green and my sister's color is light blue. If some has a very harsh voice, you can say they have black color voice. If they have a very soft voice, you can say they have white color. I have seen a girl whose voice color is white but I did not see anyone with black color voice.
