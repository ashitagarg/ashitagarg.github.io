Naughty Amelia was walking down the path  
She felt tired and wanted to have a bath

She was going to work as a maid  
But Roger's family doesn't like the tricks she played

Walking Amelia dashed into a light  
Then she realized it was a dream  
She was sleeping, she fell from her bed  
And it was still night
