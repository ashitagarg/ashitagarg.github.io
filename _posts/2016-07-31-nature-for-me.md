title: Nature For Me

I turn, look to the left  
Boring things not worth a theft

Look, there at my right  
Nothing interesting in my sight

This is stopping me now  
Nothing for me to write about

I look so far away  
But nothing finishes my day

No matter how much I see  
Nothing interesting comes back to me

No matter how much I try  
I just can't relax my mind

That's nature for me...
